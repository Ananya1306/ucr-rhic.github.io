- Presentations: No presentation this week.

- Ananya:

- Cameron:

- David: Continuing work with FCS and working on DY analysis

- Ding: I calculated phi-meson yields of 7.2 GeV FXT and will work on phi-meson v1 vs. y in different centralities and pT window; I’m calibrating the Run20 31.2 (7.7) GeV EPD

- Erik:

- Latif: Solved the polarization offset issue when compared with Ting’s value. Working to finish another iteration for EEMC EM-Jet A_N where I plan to remove charged tracks from the jets.

- Liankun:

- William: Working on creating Dst files from the run15 data that Latif gave us. I am also creating multiple 2D histograms for Oleg so we can look at them to find bad adc channels faster.

- Xilin: Continue to work on forward upgrade inside BNL.
Also, for the diffractive jet analysis, I try to learn the motivation and modify examples from Latif to try to run the codes.

- Yang:
