------------------------------------

- Presentations: Check presentations by David and Yang posted [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ZbIyVzF9p9s5LyiuWuY3AquHTzP5Qgy).

- Ananya:


- Cameron: 

- David: Did some basic FMS QA on FMS point information

- Ding: Finish my shift as a detector operator on Tuesday. I have been doing systematic analysis on 7.2 phi-meson flow. In the meantime, I am writing the new version of my oral QE presentation. Iâ€™ll send out my slides for comments.


- Erik: 

- Latif: I finished the test sample generation for FMS Jet simulation. I am on shift this week.  


- Liankun:

- William:

- Xilin: I still focus on my CEP analysis. I try to get my new NanoDst files with some corrections. Due to the inefficiency of the condor running, my jobs usually fail this week and this situation becomes better on Wednesday. I think I can get all the NanoDst files today and start to continue on the cuts.

- Yang: Pileup events largely removed from analysis. Little changes observed at high Nch while small to negligible changes at low to intermediate Nch region. Overall pileup effects are small and don't change the correlation shape.
