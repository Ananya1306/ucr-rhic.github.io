Meeting Summary: Jan 15, 2021
----------------------------------

- Presentation: See presentation slides by David on `Ideas on DY` posted  [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hD_rjceYvKo8ave2DbiHA93D7MqhQwT7)

- Ananya:

- Cameron:  Wrote an algorithm for auto-correlation removal in the EPD region. This is to do normal auto-correlation removal while also removing any repeat hits in the same tiles. No repeated hits have been found. Iâ€™ve started calibrating 2019 3.0 GeV FXT data for the EPD as well.

- David: Attended Initial Stages 2021 conference.  Presented ideas for DY analysis

- Ding: This week I mainly work on the Psi2 of the EPD and TPC at 7.2 GeV

- Erik:

- Latif: I submitted one abstract for APS April Meeting for EIC work and one for GHP workshop (EM-jet A_N). Work on finishing renewal report this week.

- Liankun:

- William: Working on producing dst for the run 15 longitudinal data, as well as qa for FPS/FPOST run 19. 

- Xilin: I continue to work on Fms hot channel QA from jet XY position distribution plot. Based on the hot area in the plot, I will try to mask the channel in these areas. Also I am trying to get the number of jets per run normalized by number of JP0 trigger.

- Yang:
