- Ananya:

- Cameron:

- David: Continuing with Fms DY analysis by looking at Fps Pid

- Ding: Iâ€™ve finished the EPD calibration of Run 20 7.7 GeV FXT and I am working on the phi-meson v1 in different pT Range

- Erik:

- Latif: I extended the A_N extraction method used for inclusive EM-jet to diffractive pion productions. I will give details from my slides that I posted.

- Liankun:

- William: Working on the DOE report and making changes to graphs and plots to show data more appropriately.

- Xilin: Spend not much time on forward upgrade in STAR. Continue to write the annual report of my progress this year for our group. Already finish about 50% of the draft. Will finish the report by next Wednesday. Diffractive EM-jet A_N analysis: I apply NanoDst and read the data. Also make some basic plots. Will start to do some cuts later.

- Yang: Doing systematic checks for 3gev v1 calculations. Compared results from two methods: using truncated EPD nMip as weight, using EPD as a hit detector. No differences were observed.
