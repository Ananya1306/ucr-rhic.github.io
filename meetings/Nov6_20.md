- Presentations: Check the presentation slides by Yang and plot by Ding posted [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HNO6P1Si-Ub2ODOHwYa4b9VXbB22DRQg).

- Ananya:

- Cameron:

- David: Working on FCS construction efforts and working to get FPS and FPOST hits added to analysis tree

- Ding: I am working on the elliptic flow (v2) of phi-meson at 7.2 GeV FXT.

- Erik:

- Latif: I am still working to converge on different conditions used in the other FMS EM-Jet analysis by Zhanwen so that the comparison would make more sense.

- Liankun:

- William: Looking at papers for the motivation and reasons for new analysis, as well as going through the tutorial for producing Dst. I am also looking into the outliers in my MIP peak analysis.

- Xilin: I’m still working on STAR forward upgrade. Also, I study the motivation for my new analysis “diffractive EM jet A_N on forward rapidity with FMS and EEMC”.

- Yang: I’m currently carrying out efficiency correction and systematic checks for Q cumulant analysis at 3 GeV.
